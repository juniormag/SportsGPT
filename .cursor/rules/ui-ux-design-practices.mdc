# UI/UX Design Best Practices

## Visual Design
- Establish a clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention
- Choose a cohesive color palette that reflects the brand (SportsGPT uses black background with white text)
- Use typography effectively for readability and emphasis (Inter font family)
- Maintain sufficient contrast for legibility (WCAG 2.1 AA standard)
- Design with a consistent style across the application

## Interaction Design
- Create intuitive navigation patterns
- Use familiar UI components to reduce cognitive load
- Provide clear calls-to-action to guide user behavior
- Implement responsive design for cross-device compatibility
- Use animations judiciously to enhance user experience (transition-all duration-200)

## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG guidelines for web accessibility
- Use semantic HTML to enhance screen reader compatibility
- Provide alternative text for images and non-text content (team logos)
- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements
- Test with various assistive technologies

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize images and assets to minimize load times
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Use code splitting to improve initial load performance
- Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

## User Feedback
- Incorporate clear feedback mechanisms for user actions
- Use loading indicators for asynchronous operations
- Provide clear error messages and recovery options
- Implement analytics to track user behavior and pain points

## Information Architecture
- Organize content logically to facilitate easy access
- Use clear labeling and categorization for navigation
- Implement effective search functionality
- Create a sitemap to visualize overall structure

## Mobile-First Design
- Design for mobile devices first, then scale up
- Use touch-friendly interface elements (44x44px minimum)
- Implement gestures for common actions (swipe, pinch-to-zoom)
- Consider thumb zones for important interactive elements

## Consistency
- Develop and adhere to a design system
- Use consistent terminology throughout the interface
- Maintain consistent positioning of recurring elements
- Ensure visual consistency across different sections

## Testing and Iteration
- Conduct A/B testing for critical design decisions
- Use heatmaps and session recordings to analyze user behavior
- Regularly gather and incorporate user feedback
- Continuously iterate on designs based on data and feedback

## Documentation
- Maintain a comprehensive style guide
- Document design patterns and component usage
- Create user flow diagrams for complex interactions
- Keep design assets organized and accessible to the team

## Responsive Design

### Fluid Layouts
- Use relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels
- Implement CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Design with a mobile-first approach, then scale up

### Media Queries
- Use breakpoints to adjust layouts for different screen sizes
- Focus on content needs rather than specific devices
- Test designs across a range of devices and orientations

### Images and Media
- Use responsive images with srcset and sizes attributes
- Implement lazy loading for images and videos
- Use CSS to make embedded media (like iframes) responsive

### Typography
- Use relative units (em, rem) for font sizes
- Adjust line heights and letter spacing for readability on small screens
- Implement a modular scale for consistent typography across breakpoints

### Touch Targets
- Ensure interactive elements are large enough for touch (min 44x44 pixels)
- Provide adequate spacing between touch targets
- Consider hover states for desktop and focus states for touch/keyboard

### Performance
- Optimize assets for faster loading on mobile networks
- Use CSS animations instead of JavaScript when possible
- Implement critical CSS for above-the-fold content

### Content Prioritization
- Prioritize content display for mobile views
- Use progressive disclosure to reveal content as needed
- Implement off-canvas patterns for secondary content on small screens

### Navigation
- Design mobile-friendly navigation patterns (e.g., hamburger menu)
- Ensure navigation is accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Consider using a sticky header for easy navigation access

### Forms
- Design form layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Use appropriate input types for better mobile experiences
- Implement inline validation and clear error messaging

### Testing
- Use browser developer tools to test responsiveness
- Test on actual devices, not just emulators
- Conduct usability testing across different device types

## SportsGPT Specific Guidelines

### Brand Colors
- Primary background: `#000000` (black)
- Primary text: `#ffffff` (white)
- Accent colors: `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` for backgrounds
- Opacity variations: `text-white/60`, `bg-white/10`

### Typography Scale
- Title: 32px (`text-[32px]`) with tracking `[-2.24px]`
- Input text: 26px (`text-[26px]`) with tracking `[-1.82px]`
- Card text: 22px-26px responsive (`text-[22px] lg:text-[26px]`)
- Button text: 14px (`text-[14px]`) with tracking `[-0.5px]`

### Interactive Elements
- Hover effects: `hover:scale-105`, `hover:bg-white/90`
- Transitions: `transition-all duration-200`
- Focus states: `focus:ring-0`, `focus-visible:outline-none`
- Disabled states: `disabled:opacity-50`

### Spacing System
- Container padding: 32px (`p-[32px]`)
- Element gaps: 19px (`gap-[19px]`)
- Margin bottom: 32px (`mb-[32px]`) for sections
- Border radius: rounded-3xl for containers

### Component Standards
- Team logos: 70.575px containers with proper hover states
- Buttons: specific dimensions (105px x 41px for primary)
- Cards: minimum height 169px with proper spacing
- Borders: `border-[rgba(255,255,255,0.16)]` for containers

### Best Practices Checklist
- [ ] All interactive elements are touch-friendly (44px+)
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] Responsive behavior tested on multiple devices
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all elements
- [ ] Loading states implemented for async operations
- [ ] Error states provide clear recovery options
- [ ] Images have proper alt text
- [ ] Typography scales appropriately across breakpoints
- [ ] Animations enhance rather than distract
- [ ] Performance metrics meet acceptable thresholds
